      <p class="fs-4 ">  The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the
      domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living
      relative.[8] Dogs were the first species to be domesticated[9][8] by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago[7] before
      the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of
      domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other
      canids.[11]
      
      The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical
      attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting,
      herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled
      people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic
      of frequent study.[13] This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".</p>

      <p class="fs-4 "> The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in
            the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members
            of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges
            freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill
            rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]
            
            The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth,
            and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. Cat
            communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as
            cat-specific body language. Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a predator, it is
            crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears,
            such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It also secretes and perceives pheromones.[8]
            
            Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five
            kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy.
            Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets
            has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and
            reptile species.[10]
            
            It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100
            BC,[11][12] but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred in Western Asia
            around 7500 BC.[13]
            
            As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.[14][15] As of 2017, the
            domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned[16][17][18] and around
            42 million households owning at least one cat.[19] In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated
            population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020</p>

      <p class="fs-4 ">  Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 7,000 species,[1] ranging across all continents except
          Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group is paraphyletic since it excludes the snakes and
          Amphisbaenia although some lizards are more closely related to these two excluded groups than they are to other lizards.
          Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3-meter-long Komodo dragon.
          
          Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion. Some lineages (known as "legless lizards"),
          have secondarily lost their legs, and have long snake-like bodies. Some such as the forest-dwelling Draco lizards are
          able to glide. They are often territorial, the males fighting off other males and signalling, often with bright colours,
          to attract mates and to intimidate rivals. Lizards are mainly carnivorous, often being sit-and-wait predators; many
          smaller species eat insects, while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo.
          
          Lizards make use of a variety of antipredator adaptations, including venom, camouflage, reflex bleeding, and the ability
          to sacrifice and regrow their tails.</p>
