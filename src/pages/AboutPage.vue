                  <p class="fs-4 "> The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated
                    descendant of the wolf. Also called the
                    domestic dog, it is derived from the extinct Pleistocene wolf,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the
                    dog's nearest living
                    relative.[8] Dogs were the first species to be domesticated[9][8] by hunter-gatherers over 15,000
                    years ago[7] before
                    the development of agriculture.[1] Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to
                    a large number of
                    domestic individuals[10] and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
                    inadequate for other
                    canids.[11]

                    The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and
                    physical
                    attributes.[12] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for
                    humans, such as hunting,
                    herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and
                    aiding disabled
                    people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine
                    bond has been a topic
                    of frequent study.[13] This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best
                    friend".</p>

                  <p class="fs-4 "> The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is
                    the only domesticated species in
                    the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it
                    from the wild members
                    of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the
                    feral cat ranges
                    freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their
                    ability to kill
                    rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]

                    The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick
                    reflexes, sharp teeth,
                    and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are well
                    developed. Cat
                    communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and
                    grunting as well as
                    cat-specific body language. Although the cat is a social species, it is a solitary hunter. As a
                    predator, it is
                    crepuscular, i.e. most active at dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
                    frequency for human ears,
                    such as those made by mice and other small mammals.[7] It also secretes and perceives pheromones.[8]

                    Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging
                    from two to five
                    kittens.[9] Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known
                    as cat fancy.
                    Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the
                    abandonment of pets
                    has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire
                    bird, mammal, and
                    reptile species.[10]

                    It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from
                    around 3100
                    BC,[11][12] but recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication
                    occurred in Western Asia
                    around 7500 BC.[13]

                    As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the
                    world.[14][15] As of 2017, the
                    domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats
                    owned[16][17][18] and around
                    42 million households owning at least one cat.[19] In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat,
                    with an estimated
                    population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020</p>

                  <p class="fs-4 "> Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 7,000 species,[1]
                    ranging across all continents except
                    Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group is paraphyletic since it excludes the
                    snakes and
                    Amphisbaenia although some lizards are more closely related to these two excluded groups than they
                    are to other lizards.
                    Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3-meter-long Komodo
                    dragon.

                    Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion. Some lineages (known as
                    "legless lizards"),
                    have secondarily lost their legs, and have long snake-like bodies. Some such as the forest-dwelling
                    Draco lizards are
                    able to glide. They are often territorial, the males fighting off other males and signalling, often
                    with bright colours,
                    to attract mates and to intimidate rivals. Lizards are mainly carnivorous, often being sit-and-wait
                    predators; many
                    smaller species eat insects, while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo.

                    Lizards make use of a variety of antipredator adaptations, including venom, camouflage, reflex
                    bleeding, and the ability
                    to sacrifice and regrow their tails.</p>
